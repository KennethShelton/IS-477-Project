# Data README

Raw data files (placed in `data/raw/`):

- `air_quality.csv` — NYC Air Quality dataset (data.gov). Contains pollutant measures with `Geo Join ID` and `Geo Place Name` and `Time Period`.
- `NYNY_BenMAP.csv` — EnviroAtlas BenMAP results by block group. Contains `bgrp` (block group id) and many health impact estimate columns (NO2, O3, PM25, SO2 related metrics).

Checksums:
- `data/raw/checksums.txt` contains SHA256 checksums for the raw CSV files. Use `Get-FileHash` in PowerShell or another tool to verify file integrity.

Processed data (generated by cleaning scripts):
- `data/processed/air_quality_clean.csv` — cleaned version with a normalized `year` column.
- `data/processed/Nyny_BenMAP_clean.csv` — benmap with an added `pm25_negative_flag` column indicating how many PM25-related columns were negative for a given row.

Notes:
- Large raw CSVs may be imported directly into SQLite using `scripts/load_data.py`. The load script prefers `pandas` but has a csv/sqlite fallback.
- Run `scripts/inspect.py` to create `docs/inspect_report.txt` with a quick summary of the raw files.
